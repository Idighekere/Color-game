# ChromaQuest: A Color Matching Challenge 🎨

## Overview
ChromaQuest is a fast-paced, interactive web-based game designed to test your ability to perceive and match colors accurately. Developed using vanilla JavaScript and modern CSS techniques, this project provides a seamless user experience with real-time score tracking, dynamic color generation, and engaging feedback animations. It’s a perfect blend of logic and visual design, showcasing clean DOM manipulation and state management.

## Features
- **Dynamic Hex Generation**: Every round generates six unique hex colors, ensuring no two games are ever the same.
- **Interactive UI Feedback**: Uses custom CSS animations to provide immediate visual cues for correct and incorrect guesses.
- **State Persistence**: Tracks your score throughout the session and resets gracefully upon game completion.
- **Immersive Elements**: Integrated with the `canvas-confetti` library to celebrate your high scores.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens using flexible CSS containers.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Idighekere/Color-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Color-game
   ```

3. **Launch the Game**:
   Since this is a client-side web application, you don't need to install any dependencies. Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:
   - Double-click `index.html` in your file explorer.
   - Or, if you use VS Code, right-click and select **Open with Live Server**.

## Usage
The objective of the game is simple: identify which of the six color options matches the large central color box.

1. **The Target**: Observe the color displayed in the top box.
2. **The Guess**: Click on one of the six color buttons below that you believe matches the target.
3. **Winning**: If you guess correctly, your score increases, and a success message appears. You can then click "Next" to continue.
4. **Losing**: Selecting the wrong color triggers a "Game Over" modal. From here, you can start a fresh game by clicking the "New Game" button.
